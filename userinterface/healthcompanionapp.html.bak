			<h1>Health Companion App - Case Study</h1>
			<p>A UX design journey to create a medication management solution.</p>

		<!-- Introduction Section -->
		<section id="introduction" class="container my-5">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>A few weeks ago, one of my friends had to miss a meeting for a project weâ€™re working on. It turned out he had to visit his hospitalized grandfather. He would then vent about him forgetting to take his essential medication. The day after, we were realizing the project we were working on was going nowhere, then I remembered my good friendâ€™s story the day before. Once I proposed finding a solution to the problem with his grandfather, we all started exploring.</p>
			
		</section>

		<!-- The Challenge -->
		<section id="challenge" class="container my-5">
			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>Considering who our potential users be, we need to find what the demographic is for people who are under much medication and/or have a deteriorating health. Then, we need to find a solution which is simple and accessible to that demographic. The question arises of how to make the solution work. The goal of this app, its objective, will be to facilitate the managing of medications and necessary doctorâ€™s appointments, and to ultimately avoid situations like that of my friendâ€™s grandfather.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- User Research -->
		<section id="research" class="container my-5">
			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p>To find out the demographic of our target user base, we will be distributing surveys to doctors around the country by email and social media. We will have surveys for both patients and doctors and we will encourage doctors to distribute those surveys to patients.</p>
			<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCS_R_o8YoBLAHhxEYYLsYI3sARSfz3DoPl666Z-HHeaV9Aw/viewform?usp=header">Patientâ€™s Survey</a></p>

			<p>Based on the survey responses, we will determine the typical demographic of users of our product. This includes the age group, which disease they typically suffer from and if they would be interested in a software based solution.</p>

		</section>

		<!-- Personas -->
		<section id="personas" class="container my-5">
			<h2>Personas</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Based on user research, weâ€™ve found doctors are not willing to change their current system for reminders and are usually happy about it, so there isnâ€™t much of a demand. For patients however, they often consult different doctors for different purposes, and they all have different ways to communicate reminders, making this a hassle to the patient. We have determined our core user base are patients of different backgrounds, with different levels of tech savyness.</p>

		<!-- User Journey -->
		<section id="user-journey" class="container my-5">
            <h2>User Journey</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Based on user needs, we determined we would need a mobile app which would make the user go through the following experiences with our application, which will automatically send reminders in the form of notifications to the user, emitting a special sound proper to the app so the user can recognize it.</p>

        <section id="prototype" class="container my-5">
            <h2>Wireframing and Prototype</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Based on our findings, we designed a rough wireframe of the app, then we implemented a prototype of the user interface using Figma which allows for the managing of medication reminders, appointments and contact information of doctors. The app will automatically send push notification to users based on the time associated with reminders. The appâ€™s home page displays reminders about medications and appointments, so the user is one click away from accessing those reminders.</p>

        <section id="usability" class="container my-5"> 
            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>To collect user data, we will ask the user for permission to collect data from their use of the app. That data can include which features they typically use or if they often leave blank fields when entering information for medications, appointments, and contacts. That will help us identify design problems and how to fix them. We will also be asking for user feedback through in-app notifications, asking them to rate the app and leave comments about it. We will also be relying on the app storeâ€™s review section to identify user concerns and criticism. We can then iterate and modify our prototype to fit better user needs. We also need to consider which users we typically collect data from. We can keep track of this through the optional account feature of our app and artificial intelligence to identify the profile of our users based on user-collected data.</p>
            
            <p>Though these are passive ways in which weâ€™ll be collecting user data, we also need direct real-time usability testing. To do this, we will invite users of all ages to participate in real-time usability testing. We can use monetary incentives to attract people of all ages. We will note hurdles users go through when using our app. We can directly answer questions such as:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Are any essential features difficult to access?</li>
                <li>What feelings can be noted from users when navigating our interface?</li>
                <li>Does the user interface feel unsettling?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>During those sessions, we will also propose variants of the prototype with different colors and text sizes. We will be asking them directly which ones they prefer and feel comfortable with. Finally, we will ask to meet them again at a future date, leaving them with a copy of the prototype and encouraging them to use it. At this future date, we will interview those users about their experiences while using the prototype and if they stopped using it altogether. If they did, what are the reasons they can identify?</p>

        <section id="reflection" class="container my-5"> 
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Going through the UX design process really helped us understand what users need and how to make the app simple and easy to use. We focused on designing a system that helps people remember their medications and appointments without adding stress to their daily lives.</p>
            
            <p>One of the biggest things we learned was that simplicity is key. Some users, like elderly people or busy parents, donâ€™t have time to figure out complicated apps. Thatâ€™s why we made sure our design is straightforward, with clear reminders and an easy setup process.</p>
            
            <p>A challenge we faced was balancing features with usability. We wanted to include reminders, appointment scheduling, and caregiver support, but we also didnâ€™t want the app to feel overwhelming. To solve this, we focused on keeping the most important features front and center while still allowing users to customize settings if they wanted to.</p>
            
            <p>Another challenge was making sure the app works for both tech-savvy users and those who arenâ€™t as comfortable with technology. To fix this, we designed it so that family members or caregivers can help set up reminders if needed. We also used simple push notifications so users donâ€™t have to do muchâ€”they just get reminded and take their meds.</p>
            
            <p>By testing different ideas and improving the design, we made sure the app is practical, easy to use, and actually helpful. In the future, we could add more personalization, voice reminders, or even AI-based tracking to make it even better. The main goal is to keep it simple and useful so people can stay on top of their health without extra hassle.</p>
